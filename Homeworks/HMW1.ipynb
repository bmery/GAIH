    "    first we remove duplicate records for not give that particular data object an advantage or bias, when running machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "    feature engineering is another important step. If some features correlated each other, we need to remove one of them. Also some features\n",
    "    features can be grouped together and used like categories or classes. And after that non numeric features can be transformed into \n",
    "    dummy features or if values are ordinal then we can use values like 1,2,3 etc.\n",
    "    then we need to seperate data for train and test. cross validation tecniques can be used.\n"
